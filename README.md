## Requirements

If you want me to speak at your event, here is a list of non-negotiable requirements I have.

### Regarding the events

- Your event is welcoming to everyone, no matter where they come from, their social status, gender, orientation, culture, beliefs, education and their mental or physical abilities.
- Your event needs to provide easy access for wheelchair users and people with reduced mobility.
- Your event has an enforced Code of Conduct (if you have none, check [confcodeofconduct.com](https://github.com/confcodeofconduct/confcodeofconduct.com) for a great example).

### Regarding my talk

- You want me to speak at your event because you find my content valuable for your attendees, not because you expect my employer to sponsor your event (which doesn't mean it's not a possibility).
- If you my talk is recorded, the video need to be freely available without registration requires, and cannot be sold in any capacity.
- I will only be using my laptop, and my clicker (remote presenter) to present: I can connect without issues to a projector using USB-C (Thunderbolt 4), HDMI, DisplayPort & VGA.
- I'm not giving my slides in advance unless there are live interprets, but I will gladly provide them and code examples after my talk. I always share them in my [speaking page](https://fred.dev/speaking/).
- I'm not using any conference slide templates. I spend a lot of time crafting the visual for my slides. If absolutely necessary, I can make an exception for the title slide.

### Regarding the Travel

- If your organization is taking care of my flights, please validate the date and time with me first. Use [Air Canada](https://www.aircanada.com) or a [Star Alliance member](https://www.staralliance.com/en/members).
- For flights longer than four hours, please book business class or at a minimum, premium economy.
- Unless the event is local, I will arrive at a minium one day before the event (no red eyes to arrive the day of the event).
- Unless this is a short flight and I can arrive home in the evening, I will leave the day after.
- If your organization is taking care of the accommodation, I prefer [Hilton](https://www.hilton.com) or [Marriot](https://www.marriott.com). If it's not possible, any other hotels will do, but no Airbnb please.

## Prioritization

The public speaking season is busy, so it's not always possible for me to present at all events. I will prioritize the ones that are:

- Giving me a prime speaking slot (not the morning after the conference party, nor the last session of the day or right after lunch).
- Recording the talk.
- Paying for the travel arrangements.
- Taking real steps to promote diversity.

## Keep in mind that

- I'm happy to give more than one talk at your event to maximize my presence.
- French is my first language, but I highly prefer to deliver my presentations in English.
- I'll be more than happy to mentor other speakers.
