# Unleash your superpowers with GitHub Actions workflows

We are all familiar with GitHub as our main collaboration tools for anything code related, and you may even already use Actions workflows, but are you really unleashing your superpowers while doing it?

Whether you are new to them or already a connoisseur, we will explore the syntax, triggers and commands to get you started with some workflows creation. You will also become savvy by extending our newly created workflows to more advanced usage demonstrations, while learning how to reuse them or even make them available in the GitHub Marketplace.

From traditional operations like code linting, to pull requests validations, passing by integration with other technologies and customization for your special needs, you will go back home with all the tools you need to bring your GitHub Actions workflows game to the next level.
