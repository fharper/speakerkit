# The Secret Sauce for Building a Developer Community

Are you building a developer tool? Maybe your software or service isn't targeted to developers, but has a technical component for them to use it? In both cases, no matter how extraordinary the masterpiece you are crafting is, it will be quite an achievement to be successful without a community. Whether your product is open source, proprietary, free, paid or a well-balanced mix of those, not fostering a developer, DevOps and or GitOps community can be a costly business mistake.

In this session, we will explore the best practices, tips, and tricks drawn from the secret sauce behind any successful developer relations programs when it comes to communities building. In the end, youâ€™ll be equipped, no matter your role, to grow, and cultivate your very own healthy community where each side will find benefits.

With this talk, I want to help anyone, who is building software, understand that creating and fostering a healthy community is not optional anymore.

Developers, DevOps or GitOps practitioners (me included), want to be part of something bigger than themselves. They want to fit in. They want to be heard. They want to create a relationship with a company, and see that there is a human side.

There are also ample benefits on the business side in addition to ensuring you fill the needs of your users. The feedback loop becomes fluid. The growth, if done right, should be exponential, meaning more users, more paid customers, or clients investing more money in your platform.

There are specific techniques to be successful when creating a cloud native community, and I intend to share the best practices to connect with a developer and technical audience, which should be approached with some guidelines in mind.
