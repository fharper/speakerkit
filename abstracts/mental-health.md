# Don't .gitignore mental health

‚ö†Ô∏è **Content Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Depression, dark thoughts,  anxiety ‚Äì These are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society, and it‚Äôs even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep.

More than ever, we need to talk about mental health! This is why I want to share my experience with depression, general anxiety, ADHD, and experience volunteering at a suicide prevention hotline. Along with my thoughts on how we can improve the situation, I‚Äôll be sharing some tips to help people be more open about these topics and issues ‚Äì more importantly, I want to touch on how those struggling can ask for help and assistance when needed.

## Details

I want people to get out of this talk with four specific things:

1. Being a little more comfortable to speak and discuss about mental health.
2. Have tricks on how to prevent depression and burnout.
3. Being able to identify some signs of colleagues or friends who aren't going well
4. Knowing what to do and where to find help if you are having a difficult time and suicidal ideas.

It's not an easy topic... I've done a major depression in 2015, and still struggling with it to this day. Still, I was able to find help, and strategies to help me go forward, and you can consider I have a successful professional and personal life, even if I'm still fighting my demons. I'm also really public about it and I'm a public speaker by profession, so talking about the topic and my experience isn't an issue for me.

To be honest, if one, only one person goes out from this talk and decides to ask for help, I'll consider myself successful!
