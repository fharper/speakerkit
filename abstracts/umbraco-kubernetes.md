# Scaling Umbraco with Kubernetes without burning the place down

Content Management Systems are often managed in a traditional way: running in a single environment, updated nervously, manually scaled only when traffic explodes, all this with your fingers crossed. Sometimes it’s enough, but more often than not your solution needs to be more resilient, scalable, observable, and predictable under load for the sake of your users. Kubernetes, even if not magic, will definitely help you scale Umbraco.

In this talk I’ll walk you through what using cloud native technologies with Umbraco looks like. We’ll explore the decisions you need to make and how to avoid setting your infrastructure on fire. Expect practical advice on how to design your architecture (frontend vs back office), common pitfalls, managing stateful components like the database, scaling and rollback patterns if everything goes to hell, all while being cloud-agnostic.
