# Creating for everyone: understanding accessibility

Accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with declared disabilities. There are a wide range of limitations including visual, auditory, cognitive, motor, and neurological challenges, many of which are invisible, temporary, or situational. Unfortunately, accessibility is often only treated as a legal obligation where it’s required by law, or as an afterthought when building web applications or creating content. In practice, it should be at the forefront of everything we do on the web because it directly affects how people can interact with your applications or if they can even consume your content.

This talk introduces accessibility from a practical perspective. It is aimed at content creators, and developers who are not accessibility specialists. Using real-world examples, this session explains the core principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) in plain language. In the end, the attendees will leave with a clearer understanding of why accessibility matters, how small decisions can create or prevent major barriers, and how designing with accessibility in mind leads to better usage experiences for all, regardless of ability, environment, device, or context.
