# Extend Moodle’s capabilities through custom plugins

Moodle is a powerful Learning Management System, but sometimes you need to go beyond its core features. Fortunately, it’s easy to extend its functionalities using modular components called plugins. Thanks to the amazing Moodle community, thousands of them are available in the official directory. If you can’t find the functionality you need there, you may want to consider building your own custom plugin.

In this talk, we’ll explore how to build a Moodle plugin from scratch. Among other things, we will demystify the most common plugin types, learn about the Moodle coding guidelines which ensure a higher level of quality and standards within the platform, explore best practices for plugin creation, and define the steps needed to ensure your new masterpiece is accepted in the directory, if it's your heart's desire. If you go that route, you will also go back home with a better understanding on what is important from the Moodle team’s point of view to ensure the best experience, and hopefully, go through the review process in a breeze.
