# Surfing the Argo CD sync waves

If you want to be successful in your cloud native journey, a good Kubernetes-native continuous deployment (CD) tool is indispensable. You also want a declarative GitOps CD if you stick to the GitOps principles, and manage your cluster with a single source of truth, the Git repository. There are some interesting choices out there, Argo CD being one of the best. In this talk, let’s surf the sync waves together, and learn the intrinsic parts of using Argo CD to deploy, and manage applications on your clusters. We’ll explore the insightful web UI, but also play with the CLI for terminal lovers. You’ll also end up with a broader comprehension of GitOps through the lenses of Argo CD while improving your application lifecycle management (ALM).

## Details

I firmly believe it's beneficial to the cloud native ecosystem to not just learn about CNCF projects, and educate users about any open source projects that can help them being successful. Argo CD is one of the leaders when it comes to an open source alternative for GitOps ecosystems, providing a high production-ready quality continuous deployment tool. In this talk, the attendees will learn more about how to leverage GitOps with Argo CD to bring their Kubernetes game to the next level.
