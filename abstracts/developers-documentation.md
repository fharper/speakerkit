## Outline

This talk is divided in three main acts, mainly focusing on tips, tricks and interesting examples to unleash your secret weapon, your developers documentation:

- First, I explore the unknown and something undervalued benefits of an amazing documentation for developers. In other words, the benefits and possible return on investment of listening to this talk.
- Secondly, I focus on the content part of the documentation: obviously the most important part of the documentation, but quite often neglected, which result in a poor experience for the users and customers.
- Lastly, before encouraging attendees to take their developers documentation to the next level, I explore the container part of a successful documentation.
