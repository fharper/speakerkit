# From <textarea> to superpowers: building serious editors in Angular with TinyMCE

Text editing looks easy… right up until your users ask for the features described as "those Google Docs things". Suddenly your innocent textarea is no longer cutting it. In this session, we’ll walk through integrating TinyMCE into an Angular application step-by-step, starting from a basic setup, and then turning it into a fully featured collaborative editing experience. Whether you’re building an LMS, CMS or any other Management System, you’ll find there’s something for everyone.

We’ll explore advanced collaboration workflow features like Suggested Edits, Comments, Revision History, and anything else that will help your users create amazing content faster with plugins like AI assistant. This workshop is for Angular developers who want to build rich text editing experiences without spending months coding and maintaining a custom WYSIWYG. No marketing fluff, but also no magic: just practical Angular patterns, real problems, and tools that help you ship faster. If you’ve ever underestimated “just adding a text editor” to your project, this talk is for you!
