## Mental Health
### Don't .gitignore mental health
Depression, suicide, and anxiety are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society and even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep. We need to talk about mental health more than ever! This is why I want to share my experience with depression and my view on how we can improve the situation, as well as some tips to help people be more open and be able to ask for help when they need it.


## Open Source
### How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps
Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‘Where should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input?? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?’ Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.

**Details**

Open source is part of every developer's life these days: if it's not from your own, a library or framework you are probably using has some open building pieces. Still, it's a minimal part of our community that participate, so I want to help people understand the many ways they can start to be a contributor today, right after the talk. The secret sauce? It's not just about code. I'll base this on my personal experience working on OSS projects and for OSS companies.

Contributing to a project in the open is often scary. I want to demystify this, lower down the barrier to entry and give some tips on how to start and be one of our technology heroes. Yes, the title is cheesy, but I guess those titles work: we all clicked on that article someone shared on Facebook!

## Personal Branding
### Personal Branding: it’s more important than you think
Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become a  “thought leader” in your industry. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don’t need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru— you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.


## Public Speaking
### Public Speaking? It’s for you!
Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!

**Details**

The idea is to help people to go past the frightening idea of public speaking, but even more to let attendees know that they all can do it. We all had the imposter syndrome when we gave our first talk, and look at me, I gave more than 100 in the past and still love it!

## Web
### Building web apps that don’t suck
As developers, it's important to think about our users first: you need to create an awesome experience and part of the equation is to deliver quality, fast. Unfortunately, we lost the habit of being efficient with our code and assets, getting used, if you are lucky, to more and more power from our devices and internet connections. But our users want their data now. Waiting is painful, you know it! It's not an option anymore... Based on personal experience, this presentation is about concrete tips and tricks to help you optimize your masterpiece, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (most applicable to other languages).

### Magic: The GraphQL and API Gathering
How can I query multiple APIs and databases with a language that is easy, efficient and flexible but still care about structured data? I thought you would never ask! GraphQL my friends, GraphQL is the answer! Speed, efficiency and data structure are the foundation of this open source runtime and query language that you probably have heard of. In this talk, you’ll learn more about the pros and cons of this technology, how to deploy it in the cloud and how to make some magic with it. You don’t want to miss that...

**Details**

GraphQL has been open source for a couple of years, but the adoption is spiking only since the last two years. It's still an unknown technology that anyone, no matter the programming language, can benefit from. It's also a talk that is targeted to anyone using APIs or databases, which is almost anyone, no matter their level of expertise. It's also a technology that won't fade away and prove its value.
