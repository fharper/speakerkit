## Cloud Native (Kubernetes, GitOps…)

### Adopt Kubernetes Easily With kubefirst, an Open Source GitOps Platform

Ever hear someone say that Kubernetes is not complicated. It makes my head spin every time! Like with any new platform, there is a learning curve, and as with any other technology, the more experience you have, the better you become. Still, I feel like Kubernetes (K8s for close friends) introduce a lot of new concepts that were unfamiliar to us. There are also a lot of moving pieces which make the time to digest it all, longer than previous technologies we’ve learned. Don’t get me wrong, it makes sense since we are talking about a powerful platform that can scale container orchestration from a mom & pop shop, to a Google ecosystem size-wise.

Getting started is not a piece of cake, and kubefirst, a free and open source tool, comes to the rescue. It provides a fully automated application delivery and infrastructure management GitOps platform which does the hard work for you, while setting you up for success with the best cloud native tools: all that with a single command. In this talk we will cover the pros and cons of kubefirst, while giving you everything you need to get started with your very own Kubernetes deployment in a breeze.

### Git Shit Done, the GitOps Way

Are you an avid cloud user, and are now contemplating Kubernetes for your project? Did you already start to play with clusters, controllers, pods and anything K8s? In both cases, stop what you are doing right now, and let me help you in your  container orchestration journey by introducing you to GitOps. I know, I know… you barely jumped the DevOps wagon, and there is already this new kid in town. Worry not my friend, because this talk will set you on the path to success for implementing Continuous Deployment (CD) for cloud native applications. You’ll learn what the hell is GitOps, and how it will help you better collaborate with your team, deploy & iterate faster within a more secure environment, while saving some costs on the road. In the end, you’ll leave with concrete steps to implement best practices to get shit done, the GitOps way!

#### Details

I firmly believe that when one is thinking about using Kubernetes, GitOps is the way to go. It's slowly becoming an accepted standard, but it's still quite unknown or not used enough as a starting point when one is beginning its cloud native journey. I want to honestly highlight the pros, and cons of the GitOps principles to let people choose their path, armed with the proper information, when it comes to creating, and managing clusters. Whether you agree about the fact that GitOps should be a de facto best practice, you can't deny that your attendees need to learn about the principles, and how to get started before making this architectural decision.

### Moving to Kubernetes Without Losing Your Sanity

Are you flirting with the idea of moving your application from traditional cloud to Kubernetes? You read about it, explored this new adventure, and now you are daydreaming about the time you could simply deploy your application without having to think about clusters, pods, and Ingress Controllers. It was the Good Ol' Days, right?

It might seem like it, but trust me, there are ways to make the move without losing your sanity! In this talk, I will help you get started like it was a skill you owned since your first line of code. With some best practices of taken from the DevOps space (i.e. Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration, Continuous Development), to the GitOps principles, we will explore together the tools at your disposal to make a flawless transition into the new age of cloud native apps.

#### Details

With this talk, I want to ease the pain that most developers had when they decided to move to Kubernetes.

The goal is to simplify this technology, and share tips, best practices, and principles they should know to make their life easier.

As mentioned in the abstract, things like best practices around CI, CD, IaC, open source tools, and GitOps principles like having a git repository as their source of truth, to establish better collaboration, a secure environment, lengthy traceability, and much more.

The end goal is to:

- help developers get started with Kubernetes as easily, and quickly as possible.
- help people who are already playing in the container, and cloud native space to be successful.

### Moving to Kubernetes—And Containers—Without Losing Your Sanity

> This is similar to the talk "Moving to Kubernetes Without Losing Your Sanity", with the addition of focusing on standard containerization of applications as in using tools like Docker or Podman.

Are you flirting with the idea of moving your application from traditional cloud to Kubernetes? Did you decide it was the end of the “it’s working on my machine” era by containerizing your application? You read about it, explored this new adventure, and now you are daydreaming about the time you could simply deploy your application without those new kids on the block. It was the Good Ol' Days, right?

It might seem like it, but trust me, there are ways to make the move without losing your sanity! In this talk, I will help you get started like it was a skill you owned since your first line of code. With the best practices of DevOps (i.e. Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration, Continuous Development), to the GitOps principles, we will explore together the tools at your disposal to make a flawless transition into the new age of cloud native apps.

#### Details

With this talk, I want to ease the pain that most developers had when they decided to move to Kubernetes, or containerized their apps.

The goal is to simplify these technologies, and share tips, best practices, and principles they should know to make their life easier.

As mentioned in the abstract, things like best practices around CI/CD, IaC, open source tools, and even GitOps principles like having a git repository as their source of truth, to establish better collaboration, a secure environment, lengthy traceability, and much more.

The end goal is to:

- help developers get started with containers & Kubernetes as easily, and quickly as possible.
- help people who are already playing in the container, and cloud native space to be successful.

### What the Heck Is Kubernetes

Ever wonder what that fuss is all about! Is this just a new technology that will die along the thousands of JavaScript libraries that were supposed to change the way we code? Is Kubernetes, K8s for close friends, really a game changer? Even if it was, do you or your project really need a container orchestration system with its clusters, controllers, pods and all those new moving pieces? My friend, I got your back, as all, yes, ALL your questions will be answered in this talk. We will demystify together what the heck is this thing. In the end, you’ll have a better understanding of the platform & its quirks, including the pros and cons, how to get started, and some must-know tools that will make your life easier.

## Developer Relations / Community Building

### Developer Relations Through the Roof: Measuring Developer Success

Developer Relations is all about helping developers be successful. Truth be told, it is essential to connect with your developer audience; the survival of your product and company depends on it.  With growing expertise in this field, and more companies adopting a developer success approach, one problem remains: how do you measure success? Which metrics should you consider, and what Key Performance Indicator one should monitor? How do you listen to your community to ensure you are going in the right direction? What systems should you  put in place to help you scale, and be successful? We’ll answer those questions, and much more during this talk.

### It’s a developers’ world: creating a developer relations culture

Historically, developers only engaged behind the scenes by creating software. However, today, their role is evolving. They are steadily winning seats at the table, providing a bigger vision for the business, and taking the world by storm.

In this session, we will focus on the traits needed to create and cultivate a collaborative and inclusive culture specially geared toward developers. Beyond the technicalities of the job, and beyond the size of your team, we’ll dig into the benefits of building a trust-based relationship with the developer community and its intrinsic role in the overall value of your products and business. From writing documentation to providing a space for your community to grow, and building a feedback mechanism, we’ll walk through the benefits, and steps needed to embrace an authentic and measurable DevRel Program.

#### Details

I firmly believe you cannot have a sustainable Open Source business if you do not care about your community and the developers. What's best to help you in that area is a developer advocate, or a developer relations' team. I want to highlight how this role help you with that journey, and my hope is that participants, even if they don't have the resource to hire someone to do that specifically, they can take what make sense for them to improve their relationship with developers, and help them, as the company, to be successful. In the end, I always say that developer relations is everyone's business, not just DevRel...

### The Secret Sauce for Building a Healthy Cloud Native Community

Are you building a cloud native technology? Maybe you are thinking about creating a much-needed piece of software for the Kubernetes ecosystem? In both cases, no matter how extraordinary the masterpiece you are crafting is, it will be quite an achievement to be successful without a community. Whether your product is open source, proprietary, free, paid or a well-balanced mix of those, not fostering a developer, DevOps and or GitOps community can be a costly business mistake.

In this session, we will explore the best practices, tips, and tricks drawn from the secret sauce behind any successful developer relations programs when it comes to community building. In the end, you’ll be equipped, no matter your role, to grow, and cultivate your very own healthy community where each side will find benefits.

#### Details

With this talk, I want to help anyone building for the cloud native ecosystem, that having, and fostering a healthy community is not optional anymore.

Developers, DevOps or GitOps practitioners (me included), want to be part of something bigger than themselves. They want to fit in. They want to be heard. They want to create a relationship with a company, and see that there is a human side.

There are also ample benefits on the business side in addition to ensuring you fill the needs of your users. The feedback loop becomes fluid. The growth, if done right, should be exponential, meaning more users, more paid customers, or clients investing more money in your platform.

There are specific techniques to be successful when creating a cloud native community, and I intend to share the best practices to connect with a developer and technical audience, which should be approached with some guidelines in mind.

## Documentation

### Developers Documentation: your secret weapon

You can have the best product in your expertise area, but if your documentation isn’t on par with the flawless experience you want to offer to the world, success is not guaranteed. Let’s be real here: documentation is often an afterthought and rarely included in life cycle development processes. Still, documentation is the secret weapon for greater adoption, and growth that you may have not known you could achieve.

It’s time for you to step up your game and measure up to the big players. Learn about the benefits of high quality and educational documentation and the true role it plays in the developer community. You’ll also learn the principles of a solid foundation, and tips on how to use one of the most powerful developer relations’ tools.

#### Outline

This talk is divided in three main acts, mainly focusing on tips, tricks and interesting examples to unleash your secret weapon, your developers documentation:

- First, I explore the unknown and something undervalued benefits of an amazing documentation for developers. In other words, the benefits and possible return on investment of listening to this talk.
- Secondly, I focus on the content part of the documentation: obviously the most important part of the documentation, but quite often neglected, which result in a poor experience for the users and customers.
- Lastly, before encouraging attendees to take their developers documentation to the next level, I explore the container part of a successful documentation.

## Low-Code / No-Code

### Low-Code and No-Code: a Developer Superpower

Once upon a time, a developer read an article about these low-code and no-code concepts. The developer wasn’t quite sure of the benefits, if any, of those new paradigms. It is, after all, his job to create applications, and he is pretty good at it!

“Why would someone limit themselves to a predefined, or mostly already defined approach”, the developer asked himself! But one day, the developer woke up, agitated by a dream. “Was this real? Is this really possible? Maybe the low and no-code approaches aren’t that bad after all…”. But what was that dream? What makes him change his mind?

#### Details

This session will dive into the value of leveraging low-code and no-code, and the specific benefits seasoned developers gain from this approach. Navigate this “dream” with us, as we go beyond the ease of use, from customization to testing capabilities and today’s sought-after productivity boost. We will dive into specific examples of use cases that will help demystify the value of low-code, no-code as a business strategy.

## Mental Health

### You Don't Need to Be a Buddhist to Meditate

Buddhism aside, meditation is a practice that is more and more popular in the western world. For a reason, consistency on meditating, even for five short minutes a day, brings a lot of benefits. I am, in fact, the living proof of that. Let me share with you why you should pause your life for a moment to train your attention and awareness. No need for special cushions or burning incense: you'll learn how to start meditating today.

### Don't .gitignore mental health

⚠️ **Content Warning** ⚠️

Depression, dark thoughts,  anxiety – These are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society, and it’s even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep.

More than ever, we need to talk about mental health! This is why I want to share my experience with depression, general anxiety, ADHD, and experience volunteering at a suicide prevention hotline. Along with my thoughts on how we can improve the situation, I’ll be sharing some tips to help people be more open about these topics and issues – more importantly, I want to touch on how those struggling can ask for help and assistance when needed.

#### Details

I want people to get out of this talk with four specific things:

1. Being a little more comfortable to speak and discuss about mental health.
2. Have tricks on how to prevent depression and burnout.
3. Being able to identify some signs of colleagues or friends who aren't going well
4. Knowing what to do and where to find help if you are having a difficult time and suicidal ideas.

It's not an easy topic... I've done a major depression in 2015, and still struggling with it to this day. Still, I was able to find help, and strategies to help me go forward, and you can consider I have a successful professional and personal life, even if I'm still fighting my demons. I'm also really public about it and I'm a public speaker by profession, so talking about the topic and my experience isn't an issue for me.

To be honest, if one, only one person goes out from this talk and decides to ask for help, I'll consider myself successful!

#### Tweet

Discussing mental health is still taboo in the developer world, where working long hours & lack of sleep are badges of honor. Don't .gitignore mental health is the message @fharper is sharing! Come learn how to be more open about it, for yourself & other 💜

## Open Source

### How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps

Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‘Where should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?’ Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.

#### Details

Open source is part of every developer's life these days: if it's not from your own, a library or framework you are probably using has some open building pieces. Still, it's a minimal part of our community that participate, so I want to help people understand the many ways they can start to be a contributor today, right after the talk. The secret sauce? It's not just about code. I'll base this on my experience working on OSS projects and for OSS companies.

Contributing to a project in the open is often scary. I want to demystify this, lower down the barrier to entry and give some tips on how to start and be one of our technology heroes. Yes, the title is cheesy, but I guess those titles work: we all clicked on that article someone shared on Facebook!

## Personal Branding

### A Personal Brand? Surprise, you already have one!

Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become a  “thought leader” in your industry. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don’t need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru— you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.

#### Outline

This presentation starts with a simple, but important explanation about personal branding: what is it exactly? It's followed by mentioning the different advantages to take the ownership of ours, since we already have one anyway. The majority of the talk is focused on giving advices to grow, and make the best out of our very own personal brand. The audience will get actionable steps they can take right after the event to start their journey.

## Public Speaking

### Public Speaking? It’s for you!

Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!

#### Details

The idea is to help people to go past the frightening idea of public speaking, but even more to let attendees know that they all can do it. We all had the imposter syndrome when we gave our first talk, and look at me, I gave more than 100 in the past and still love it!

## Workshops

### kubefirst

Ever hear someone say that Kubernetes is not complicated. It makes Frédéric Harper’s, Principal Developer Advocate at kubefirst, head spin every time! Getting started is no piece of cake, so this is where, kubefirst, a free and open source tool, comes to the rescue. In this workshop, Fred will show you how to use our CLI to deploy a new Kubernetes cluster in minutes, with the most popular cloud native tools. We will install the CLI, deploy a new cluster locally using k3d & Docker, and we will explore its pieces. Since your new cluster is already fully functional, we will discuss the GitOps principles with your new "source of truth repository”, use Terraform with Atlantis, add a new user using HashiCorp Vault, surf the Argo CD sync waves, and master the magic steps to deploy a new application in the cloud. You can't miss this, we'll have some K8s fun!
