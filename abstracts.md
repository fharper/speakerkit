## Documentation

### Developers Documentation: your secret weapon

You can have the best product in your expertise area, but if your documentation isn’t on par with the flawless experience you want to offer to the world, success is not guaranteed. Let’s be real here: documentation is often an afterthought and rarely included in life cycle development processes. Still, documentation is the secret weapon for greater adoption, and growth that you may have not known you could achieve.

It’s time for you to step up your game and measure up to the big players. Learn about the benefits of high quality and educational documentation and the true role it plays in the developer community. You’ll also learn the principles of a solid foundation, and tips on how to use one of the most powerful developer relations’ tools.

## Low-Code / No-Code

### Low-Code and No-Code: a Developer Superpower

Once upon a time, a developer read an article about these low-code and no-code concepts. The developer wasn’t quite sure of the benefits, if any, of those new paradigms. It is, after all, his job to create applications, and he is pretty good at it!

“Why would someone limit themselves to a pre, or mostly already defined approach”, the developer asked himself! But one day, the developer woke up, agitated by a dream. “Was this real? Is this really possible? Maybe the low and no-code approaches aren’t that bad after all…”. But what was that dream? What makes him change his mind?

#### Details

This session will dive into the value of leveraging low-code and no-code, and the specific benefits seasoned developers gain from this approach. Navigate this “dream” with us, as we go beyond the ease of use, from customization to testing capabilities and today’s sought-after productivity boost. We will dive into specific examples of use cases that will help demystify the value of low-code, no-code as a business strategy.

## Mental Health

### You Don't Need to Be a Buddhist to Meditate

Buddhism aside, meditation is a practice that is more and more popular in the western world. For a reason, consistency on meditating, even for five short minutes a day, brings a lot of benefits. I am, in fact, the living proof of that. Let me share with you why you should pause your life for a moment to train your attention and awareness. No need for special cushions or burning incense: you'll learn how to start meditating today.

### Don't .gitignore mental health

⚠️ **Content Warning** ⚠️

Depression, dark thoughts,  anxiety – These are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society, and it’s even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep.

More than ever, we need to talk about mental health! This is why I want to share my experience with depression, general anxiety, ADHD, and experience volunteering at a suicide prevention hotline. Along with my thoughts on how we can improve the situation, I’ll be sharing some tips to help people be more open about these topics and issues – more importantly, I want to touch on how those struggling can  ask for help and assistance when needed.

#### Details

I want people to get out of this talk with four specific things:

1. Being a little more comfortable to speak and discuss about mental health.
2. Have tricks on how to prevent depression and burnout.
3. Being able to identify some signs of colleagues or friends who aren't going well
4. Knowing what to do and where to find help if you are having a difficult time and suicidal ideas.

It's not an easy topic... I've done a major depression in 2015, and still struggling with it to this day. Still, I was able to find help, and strategies to help me go forward, and you can consider I have a successful professional and personal life, even if I'm still fighting my demons. I'm also really public about it and I'm a public speaker by profession, so talking about the topic and my experience isn't an issue for me.

To be honest, if one, only one person goes out from this talk and decides to ask for help, I'll consider myself successful!

## Open Source

### How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps

Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‘Where should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input?? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?’ Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.

#### Details

Open source is part of every developer's life these days: if it's not from your own, a library or framework you are probably using has some open building pieces. Still, it's a minimal part of our community that participate, so I want to help people understand the many ways they can start to be a contributor today, right after the talk. The secret sauce? It's not just about code. I'll base this on my personal experience working on OSS projects and for OSS companies.

Contributing to a project in the open is often scary. I want to demystify this, lower down the barrier to entry and give some tips on how to start and be one of our technology heroes. Yes, the title is cheesy, but I guess those titles work: we all clicked on that article someone shared on Facebook!

## Personal Branding

### Personal Branding: it’s more important than you think

Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become a  “thought leader” in your industry. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don’t need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru— you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.

## Public Speaking

### Public Speaking? It’s for you!

Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!

#### Details

The idea is to help people to go past the frightening idea of public speaking, but even more to let attendees know that they all can do it. We all had the imposter syndrome when we gave our first talk, and look at me, I gave more than 100 in the past and still love it!
