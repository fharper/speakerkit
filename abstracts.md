## Cloud Native (Kubernetes, GitOps…)

### A Kubernetes’ guide for old-timers

Remember when FTP was all the rage when it came to deploying an application on your server. A time when the term “cloud computing” wasn’t even a thing. A moment in space, for which “cloud native” would make sense only weather wise. In a Kubernetes’ world, it’s critical to understand this new paradigm shift in software deployment, scalability, and management. In this talk, we’ll learn more about Kubernetes by making clear parallels between the world before and this newish open-source container orchestration system. You will become familiar enough to get started on this new pods and clusters journey.

### Adopt Kubernetes Easily With kubefirst, an Open Source GitOps Platform

Ever hear someone say that Kubernetes is not complicated. It makes my head spin every time! Like with any new platform, there is a learning curve, and as with any other technology, the more experience you have, the better you become. Still, I feel like Kubernetes (K8s for close friends) introduce a lot of new concepts that were unfamiliar to us. There are also a lot of moving pieces which make the time to digest it all, longer than previous technologies we’ve learned. Don’t get me wrong, it makes sense since we are talking about a powerful platform that can scale container orchestration from a mom & pop shop, to a Google ecosystem size-wise.

Getting started is not a piece of cake, and kubefirst, a free and open source tool, comes to the rescue. It provides a fully automated application delivery and infrastructure management GitOps platform which does the hard work for you, while setting you up for success with the best cloud native tools: all that with a single command. In this talk we will cover the pros and cons of kubefirst, while giving you everything you need to get started with your very own Kubernetes deployment in a breeze.

### Bring your Kubernetes game to the next level with these open-source tools

No matter if you are a carpenter, a baker, or a developer, there’s no denying that using the right tools can make the difference between doing the job correctly, sometimes even painfully, or absolutely mastering your art. It is the same for DevOps engineers and GitOps practitioners: you can be more productive, agile, and truly take ownership of your Kubernetes journey. This talk will present, and demonstrate the most useful, and powerful open source utilities available out there. Whether you are new to the cloud native space, or are a K8s connoisseur, your pod life will never be the same!

_Characters: 425_

#### Details

I firmly believe that when one is thinking about using Kubernetes, GitOps is the way to go. It's slowly becoming an accepted standard, but it's still quite unknown or not used enough as a starting point when one is beginning its cloud native journey. I want to honestly highlight the pros, and cons of the GitOps principles to let people choose their path, armed with the proper information, when it comes to creating, and managing clusters. Whether you agree about the fact that GitOps should be a de facto best practice, you can't deny that your attendees need to learn about the principles, and how to get started before making this architectural decision.

### Indiana Jones and the Temple of Secrets

Forget the Lost Ark and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Indiana Jones' perilous journey was nothing until the day he traveled to the unexplored territories of Cloudy Nativa, and encountered his biggest mystery so far: the discovery of the Temple of Secrets! Don’t be afraid my friends, as I’ll guide Indy toward managing his applications’ secrets with a special weapon of mine that I call, HashiCorp Vault, which will leave him undetected by the local tribe, the Kubernasty, known for being pod killers. In the end, Dr. Jones will go back to his day-to-day grinds with tips, and tricks on how to properly manage the secrets he discovered during his latest adventures, and be prepared for any disaster (and recovery) that may arise in the future. Nothing short of what would have made professor Jones, his dad, quite proud.

## Developer Relations / Community Building

### Developer Relations Through the Roof: Measuring Developer Success

Developer Relations is all about helping developers be successful. Truth be told, it is essential to connect with your developer audience; the survival of your product and company depends on it.  With growing expertise in this field, and more companies adopting a developer success approach, one problem remains: how do you measure success? Which metrics should you consider, and what Key Performance Indicator one should monitor? How do you listen to your community to ensure you are going in the right direction? What systems should you  put in place to help you scale, and be successful? We’ll answer those questions, and much more during this talk.

_Characters: 652_

### It’s a developers’ world: creating a developer relations culture

Historically, developers only engaged behind the scenes by creating software. However, today, their role is evolving. They are steadily winning seats at the table, providing a bigger vision for the business, and taking the world by storm.

In this session, we will focus on the traits needed to create and cultivate a collaborative and inclusive culture specially geared toward developers. Beyond the technicalities of the job, and beyond the size of your team, we’ll dig into the benefits of building a trust-based relationship with the developer community and its intrinsic role in the overall value of your products and business. From writing documentation to providing a space for your community to grow, and building a feedback mechanism, we’ll walk through the benefits, and steps needed to embrace an authentic and measurable DevRel Program.

_Characters: 848_

#### Details

I firmly believe you cannot have a sustainable Open Source business if you do not care about your community and the developers. What's best to help you in that area is a developer advocate, or a developer relations' team. I want to highlight how this role help you with that journey, and my hope is that participants, even if they don't have the resource to hire someone to do that specifically, they can take what make sense for them to improve their relationship with developers, and help them, as the company, to be successful. In the end, I always say that developer relations is everyone's business, not just DevRel...

_Characters: 623_

### Measuring developer relations

The million-dollar question: how do you properly measure developer relations? How is one's manager able to objectively tell if you are doing a good job or not? How can your employer decide if the return on investment (ROI) is high enough to continue to empower devrel within your organization? Hell, how do you even justify your job when the company isn’t thriving? Those are all good questions that are often left unanswered or baffle even the most experienced amongst us. Still, even if you are allergic to these terms, there are ways to define appropriate goals, track specific key performance indicators (KPI) and clearly demonstrate the benefit of developer advocacy without ending up with sales quotas or ludicrous requests. In this talk, you will learn how to realistically identify how you can set yourself for success using metrics that will solidify your impact on the business while keeping your role intact, without so much as a small headache.

### The good, the bad & the ugly of developer relations

Developer Advocate is a wonderful role. It’s a chance to help people be successful while fostering growth for your employer. It’s a perfect blend of a technical position focusing on the human side of the equation. For most of us, starting that position was a dream come true. For aspiring advocates, it is an ideal opportunity for a new career. Employment in the developer relations space is amazing, but it’s not always rainbows and unicorns. There are a lot of misunderstandings about the job itself. Often total misconceptions about the goals and approaches taken to be fruitful. Based on 14 years of being the friendly, technical, approachable, and social face of different organizations, this talk will bring some real hard truths about the good, the bad and the ugly bits of our industry. Experienced devrel people will relate, and new emerging talents could learn from the past and the shared proofed solutions, prospective workarounds and clear remedies to the less exciting part of this vocation.

### The Secret Sauce for Building a Healthy Cloud Native Community

Are you building a cloud native technology? Maybe you are thinking about creating a much-needed piece of software for the Kubernetes ecosystem? In both cases, no matter how extraordinary the masterpiece you are crafting is, it will be quite an achievement to be successful without a community. Whether your product is open source, proprietary, free, paid or a well-balanced mix of those, not fostering a developer, DevOps and or GitOps community can be a costly business mistake.

In this session, we will explore the best practices, tips, and tricks drawn from the secret sauce behind any successful developer relations programs when it comes to community building. In the end, you’ll be equipped, no matter your role, to grow, and cultivate your very own healthy community where each side will find benefits.

_Characters: 810_

#### Details

With this talk, I want to help anyone building for the cloud native ecosystem, that having, and fostering a healthy community is not optional anymore.

Developers, DevOps or GitOps practitioners (me included), want to be part of something bigger than themselves. They want to fit in. They want to be heard. They want to create a relationship with a company, and see that there is a human side.

There are also ample benefits on the business side in addition to ensuring you fill the needs of your users. The feedback loop becomes fluid. The growth, if done right, should be exponential, meaning more users, more paid customers, or clients investing more money in your platform.

There are specific techniques to be successful when creating a cloud native community, and I intend to share the best practices to connect with a developer and technical audience, which should be approached with some guidelines in mind.

## Documentation

### Developers Documentation: your secret weapon

You can have the best product in your expertise area, but if your documentation isn’t on par with the flawless experience you want to offer to the world, success is not guaranteed. Let’s be real here: documentation is often an afterthought and rarely included in life cycle development processes. Still, documentation is the secret weapon for greater adoption, and growth that you may have not known you could achieve.

It’s time for you to step up your game and measure up to the big players. Learn about the benefits of high quality and educational documentation and the true role it plays in the developer community. You’ll also learn the principles of a solid foundation, and tips on how to use one of the most powerful developer relations’ tools.

_Characters: 751_

#### Shorter Abstract

You can have the best product out there, but if your documentation isn’t on par with the experience you want to offer, success is not guaranteed. So use the documentation as your secret weapon for greater adoption, and growth that you may have not known you could achieve.

It’s time for you to step up your game! Learn about the benefits of high quality and educational documentation and the true role it plays in the developer community. You’ll also learn the principles of a solid foundation, and tips on how to use one of the most powerful developer relations’ tools.

_Characters: 571_

#### Outline

This talk is divided in three main acts, mainly focusing on tips, tricks and interesting examples to unleash your secret weapon, your developers documentation:

- First, I explore the unknown and something undervalued benefits of an amazing documentation for developers. In other words, the benefits and possible return on investment of listening to this talk.
- Secondly, I focus on the content part of the documentation: obviously the most important part of the documentation, but quite often neglected, which result in a poor experience for the users and customers.
- Lastly, before encouraging attendees to take their developers documentation to the next level, I explore the container part of a successful documentation.

## Leadership / Management

### Leading with compassion

In any article, survey or research on the reasons why people resign, in the top three, you can always find, in some form or another, “bad management”. Whether it’s more extreme as a toxic leadership team, more subtle as a lack of support or any reasons in between, it’s there, without a fault.

As a leader, the best way to foster a healthy work environment in which your team feels safe and happy, is to lead with compassion. It’s the only path to be successful in today’s competitive environment, while retaining your talent and ensuring that they can achieve greatness within your organization. In this talk, also open to individual contributors who want to show the way to their manager, we’ll explore what it means to lead with compassion. I will share concrete tips on how to prioritize your people and see productive results like you’ve never seen before.

#### Outline

In today's businesses, the pressure and expectations to ship as fast as possible while delivering quality at low cost are even more tangible than before. It's a competitive world out there, and sometimes, we focus on delivering while forgetting that our actions have consequences for our employees. I firmly believe that most managers have their team's best interests at heart, but the end results aren't always a reflection of that. This talk was created to remind the leadership team that it's possible to lead with compassion while being successful as a company.

## Mental Health

### You Don't Need to Be a Buddhist to Meditate

Buddhism aside, meditation is a practice that is more and more popular in the western world. For a reason, consistency on meditating, even for five short minutes a day, brings a lot of benefits. I am, in fact, the living proof of that. Let me share with you why you should pause your life for a moment to train your attention and awareness. No need for special cushions or burning incense: you'll learn how to start meditating today.

_Characters: 433_

### Don't .gitignore mental health

⚠️ **Content Warning** ⚠️

Depression, dark thoughts,  anxiety – These are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society, and it’s even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep.

More than ever, we need to talk about mental health! This is why I want to share my experience with depression, general anxiety, ADHD, and experience volunteering at a suicide prevention hotline. Along with my thoughts on how we can improve the situation, I’ll be sharing some tips to help people be more open about these topics and issues – more importantly, I want to touch on how those struggling can ask for help and assistance when needed.

_Characters: 768_

#### Details

I want people to get out of this talk with four specific things:

1. Being a little more comfortable to speak and discuss about mental health.
2. Have tricks on how to prevent depression and burnout.
3. Being able to identify some signs of colleagues or friends who aren't going well
4. Knowing what to do and where to find help if you are having a difficult time and suicidal ideas.

It's not an easy topic... I've done a major depression in 2015, and still struggling with it to this day. Still, I was able to find help, and strategies to help me go forward, and you can consider I have a successful professional and personal life, even if I'm still fighting my demons. I'm also really public about it and I'm a public speaker by profession, so talking about the topic and my experience isn't an issue for me.

To be honest, if one, only one person goes out from this talk and decides to ask for help, I'll consider myself successful!

## Open Source

### How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps

Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‘Where should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?’ Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.

_Characters: 443_

#### Details

Open source is part of every developer's life these days: if it's not from your own, a library or framework you are probably using has some open building pieces. Still, it's a minimal part of our community that participate, so I want to help people understand the many ways they can start to be a contributor today, right after the talk. The secret sauce? It's not just about code. I'll base this on my experience working on OSS projects and for OSS companies.

Contributing to a project in the open is often scary. I want to demystify this, lower down the barrier to entry and give some tips on how to start and be one of our technology heroes. Yes, the title is cheesy, but I guess those titles work: we all clicked on that article someone shared on Facebook!

## Public Speaking

### Public Speaking? It’s for you!

Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!

#### Details

The idea is to help people to go past the frightening idea of public speaking, but even more to let attendees know that they all can do it. We all had the imposter syndrome when we gave our first talk, and look at me, I gave more than 100 in the past and still love it!

## Workshops

### kubefirst

Ever hear someone say that Kubernetes is not complicated. It makes Frédéric Harper’s, Principal Developer Advocate at kubefirst, head spin every time! Getting started is no piece of cake, so this is where, kubefirst, a free and open source tool, comes to the rescue. In this workshop, Fred will show you how to use our CLI to deploy a new Kubernetes cluster in minutes, with the most popular cloud native tools. We will install the CLI, deploy a new cluster locally using k3d & Docker, and we will explore its pieces. Since your new cluster is already fully functional, we will discuss the GitOps principles with your new "source of truth repository”, use Terraform with Atlantis, add a new user using HashiCorp Vault, surf the Argo CD sync waves, and master the magic steps to deploy a new application in the cloud. You can't miss this, we'll have some K8s fun!
