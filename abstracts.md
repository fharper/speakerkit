## Mental Health
### Don't .gitignore mental health
Depression, suicide, and anxiety are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society and even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep. We need to talk about mental health more than ever! This is why I want to share my experience with depression and my view on how we can improve the situation, as well as some tips to help people be more open and be able to ask for help when they need it.


## Open Source
### How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps
Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‘Where should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input?? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?’ Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.


## Personal Branding
### Personal Branding: it’s more important than you think
Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it’s not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it’s never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You’ll find better jobs and become a  “thought leader” in your industry. You’ll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don’t need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru— you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.


## Public Speaking
### Public Speaking? It’s for you!
Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!


## Ruby
### No way ruby Programmers can't use this package Manager
I guess you never thought about using the gem of a tool (pun intended) that is npm. You write some JavaScript code, don’t you? Why not extend the power of Rubygems and make you life easier? Let me show you how to put your development environment on steroids using this open source tool and the endless collection of packages within the Registry.


## Web
### Building web apps that don’t suck
As developers, it's important to think about our users first: you need to create an awesome experience and part of the equation is to deliver quality, fast. Unfortunately, we lost the habit of being efficient with our code and assets, getting used, if you are lucky, to more and more power from our devices and internet connections. But our users want their data now. Waiting is painful, you know it! It's not an option anymore... Based on personal experience, this presentation is about concrete tips and tricks to help you optimize your masterpiece, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (most applicable to other languages).
