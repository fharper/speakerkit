## Cloud

### Adopt Kubernetes Easily With Kubefirst, an Open Source GitOps Platform

Ever hear someone say that Kubernetes is not complicated. It makes my head spin every time! Like with any new platform, there is a learning curve, and as with any other technology, the more experience you have, the better you become. Still, I feel like Kubernetes (K8s for close friends) introduce a lot of new concepts that were unfamiliar to us. There are also a lot of moving pieces which make the time to digest it all, longer than previous technology we‚Äôve learned. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it makes sense since we are talking about a powerful platform that can scale container orchestration from a mom & pop shop, to a Google ecosystem size-wise.

Getting started is not a piece of cake, and Kubefirst, a free and open source tool, comes to the rescue. It provides a fully automated application delivery and infrastructure management GitOps platform which does the hard work for you, while setting you up for success with the best cloud native tools: all that with a single command. In this talk we will cover the pros and cons of Kubefirst, while giving you everything you need to get started with your very own Kubernetes deployment in a breeze.

### Git Shit Done, the GitOps Way

Are you an avid cloud user, and are now contemplating Kubernetes for your project? Did you already start to play with clusters, controllers, pods and anything K8s? In both cases, stop what you are doing right now, and let me help you in your  container orchestration journey by introducing you to GitOps. I know, I know‚Ä¶ you barely jumped the DevOps wagon, and there is already this new kid in town. Worry not my friend, because this talk will set you on the path to success for implementing Continuous Deployment (CD) for cloud native applications. You‚Äôll learn what the hell is GitOps, and how it will help you better collaborate with your team, deploy & iterate faster within a more secure environment, while saving some costs on the road. In the end, you‚Äôll leave with concrete steps to implement best practices to get shit done, the GitOps way!

### What the Heck Is Kubernetes

Ever wonder what that fuss is all about! Is this just a new technology that will die along the thousands of JavaScript libraries that were supposed to change the way we code? Is Kubernetes, K8s for close friends, really a game changer? Even if it was, do you or your project really need a container orchestration system with its clusters, controllers, pods and all those new moving pieces? My friend, I got your back, as all, yes, ALL your questions will be answered in this talk. We will demystify together what the heck is this thing. In the end, you‚Äôll have a better understanding of the platform & its quirks, including the pros and cons, how to get started, and some must-know tools that will make your life easier.

## Developer Relations

### It‚Äôs a developers world: creating a developer relations culture

Historically, developers only engaged behind the scenes by creating softwares. However, today, their role is evolving. They are steadily winning seats at the table, providing a bigger vision for the business, and taking the world by storm.

In this session, we will focus on the traits needed to create and cultivate a collaborative and inclusive culture specially geared toward developers. Beyond the technicalities of the job, and beyond the size of your team, we‚Äôll dig into the benefits of building a trust-based relationship with the developer community and its intrinsic role in the overall value of your products and business. From writing documentation to providing a space for your community to grow, and building a feedback mechanism, we‚Äôll walk through the benefits, and steps needed to embrace an authentic and measurable DevRel Program.

## Documentation

### Developers Documentation: your secret weapon

You can have the best product in your expertise area, but if your documentation isn‚Äôt on par with the flawless experience you want to offer to the world, success is not guaranteed. Let‚Äôs be real here: documentation is often an afterthought and rarely included in life cycle development processes. Still, documentation is the secret weapon for greater adoption, and growth that you may have not known you could achieve.

It‚Äôs time for you to step up your game and measure up to the big players. Learn about the benefits of high quality and educational documentation and the true role it plays in the developer community. You‚Äôll also learn the principles of a solid foundation, and tips on how to use one of the most powerful developer relations‚Äô tools.

#### Outline

This talk is divided in three main acts, mainly focusing on tips, tricks and interesting examples to unleash your secret weapon, your developers documentation:

- First, I explore the unknown and something underevaluated benefits of an amazing documentation for developers. In other words, the benefits and possible return on investment of listening to this talk.
- Secondly, I focus on the content part of the documentation: the obvious important part of the documentation, but quite often neglected, which result in a poor experience for the users and customers.
- Lastly, before encouraging attendees to take their developers documentation to the next level, I explore the container part of a successful documentation.

## Low-Code / No-Code

### Low-Code and No-Code: a Developer Superpower

Once upon a time, a developer read an article about these low-code and no-code concepts. The developer wasn‚Äôt quite sure of the benefits, if any, of those new paradigms. It is, after all, his job to create applications, and he is pretty good at it!

‚ÄúWhy would someone limit themselves to a pre, or mostly already defined approach‚Äù, the developer asked himself! But one day, the developer woke up, agitated by a dream. ‚ÄúWas this real? Is this really possible? Maybe the low and no-code approaches aren‚Äôt that bad after all‚Ä¶‚Äù. But what was that dream? What makes him change his mind?

#### Details

This session will dive into the value of leveraging low-code and no-code, and the specific benefits seasoned developers gain from this approach. Navigate this ‚Äúdream‚Äù with us, as we go beyond the ease of use, from customization to testing capabilities and today‚Äôs sought-after productivity boost. We will dive into specific examples of use cases that will help demystify the value of low-code, no-code as a business strategy.

## Mental Health

### You Don't Need to Be a Buddhist to Meditate

Buddhism aside, meditation is a practice that is more and more popular in the western world. For a reason, consistency on meditating, even for five short minutes a day, brings a lot of benefits. I am, in fact, the living proof of that. Let me share with you why you should pause your life for a moment to train your attention and awareness. No need for special cushions or burning incense: you'll learn how to start meditating today.

### Don't .gitignore mental health

‚ö†Ô∏è **Content Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è

Depression, dark thoughts,  anxiety ‚Äì These are some of the words that most of us would like to add to our ignore file. Discussing mental health is still taboo in our society, and it‚Äôs even more so in the developer ecosystem, where we pride ourselves on working long hours and our lack of sleep.

More than ever, we need to talk about mental health! This is why I want to share my experience with depression, general anxiety, ADHD, and experience volunteering at a suicide prevention hotline. Along with my thoughts on how we can improve the situation, I‚Äôll be sharing some tips to help people be more open about these topics and issues ‚Äì more importantly, I want to touch on how those struggling can ask for help and assistance when needed.

#### Details

I want people to get out of this talk with four specific things:

1. Being a little more comfortable to speak and discuss about mental health.
2. Have tricks on how to prevent depression and burnout.
3. Being able to identify some signs of colleagues or friends who aren't going well
4. Knowing what to do and where to find help if you are having a difficult time and suicidal ideas.

It's not an easy topic... I've done a major depression in 2015, and still struggling with it to this day. Still, I was able to find help, and strategies to help me go forward, and you can consider I have a successful professional and personal life, even if I'm still fighting my demons. I'm also really public about it and I'm a public speaker by profession, so talking about the topic and my experience isn't an issue for me.

To be honest, if one, only one person goes out from this talk and decides to ask for help, I'll consider myself successful!

Discussing mental health is still taboo in the developer world, where working long hours & lack of sleep are badges of honor. Don't .gitignore mental health is the message @fharper is sharing! Come learn how to be more open about it, for yourself & other üíú

## Open Source

### How to become an open source contributor in 10 steps

Participating in an open source project can be intimidating, even for experienced developers. You might start asking yourself things like ‚ÄòWhere should I start? Do I have the skill set to provide valuable input?? Will my suggestion or code be well received? Does it even make sense for me to become a contributor?‚Äô Those are all valid questions and I will help answer them all by giving you an easy 10-step program to become an OSS contributor.

#### Details

Open source is part of every developer's life these days: if it's not from your own, a library or framework you are probably using has some open building pieces. Still, it's a minimal part of our community that participate, so I want to help people understand the many ways they can start to be a contributor today, right after the talk. The secret sauce? It's not just about code. I'll base this on my personal experience working on OSS projects and for OSS companies.

Contributing to a project in the open is often scary. I want to demystify this, lower down the barrier to entry and give some tips on how to start and be one of our technology heroes. Yes, the title is cheesy, but I guess those titles work: we all clicked on that article someone shared on Facebook!

## Personal Branding

### A Personal Brand? Surprise, you already have one!

Why should you care about your personal brand? After all, it‚Äôs not like you are an actor or the lead singer for a rock band. In fact, it‚Äôs never been more important for you to think about yourself as a brand. Doing so will provide rocket fuel for your career. You‚Äôll find better jobs and become a  ‚Äúthought leader‚Äù in your industry. You‚Äôll become known for your expertise and leadership; people will seek your advice and point of view. As a developer, there are many tools you can use to build a personal brand, and this presentation will help you learn how to get visibility, make a real impact, and achieve your goals. You don‚Äôt need to be a marketing expert or a personal branding guru‚Äî you can be yourself and get your dream job or reach the next level of your career.

#### Outline

This presentation starts with a simple, but important explanation about personal branding: what is it exactly? It's followed by mentioning the different advantages to take the ownership of ours, since we already have one anyway. The majority of the talk is focused on giving advices to grow, and make the best out of our very own personal brand. The audience will get actionable steps they can take right after the event to start their journey.

## Public Speaking

### Public Speaking? It‚Äôs for you!

Do you have a passion? Do you like to share with others? Public speaking can help you share this passion with others  in your industry and help them  find success. But let's be honest: you'll get a lot out of it too. You'll learn from attendees, grow your network, get visibility, and much more in return for your efforts. Let's explore how you can start getting comfortable with public speaking and how you can find opportunities to reach the perfect audience. Who knows, you could be the one speaking on this stage next time!

#### Details

The idea is to help people to go past the frightening idea of public speaking, but even more to let attendees know that they all can do it. We all had the imposter syndrome when we gave our first talk, and look at me, I gave more than 100 in the past and still love it!
