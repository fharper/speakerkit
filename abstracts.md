# Talk Abstracts

Here is a list of talks I can easily give at your events. They are a mix of new ones I never done, ones I've given in the past but would love to do again. It's also a blend technical, and non-technical topics, ranging from beginner to expert levels.

Don't limit your choice with those: I may be open to give others from my [speaking page](https://fred.dev/speaking/). I'm also always open to suggestions, so let me know if there is a specific topic you would like to have at your event, and if I have the knowledge and interest, I'll be more than happy to create one just for you.
